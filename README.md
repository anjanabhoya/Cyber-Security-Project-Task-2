# Cyber-Security-Project-Task-2
OS Security Fundamentals & Hardening (Task 2)
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my Cyber Security Internship at Elevate Labs. It focuses on understanding and implementing operating system security fundamentals, specifically for Linux and Windows environments. The goal is to apply "Hardening" techniques to reduce the attack surface of an OS.



🛠️ Tools Used

Primary OS: Ubuntu Linux (VirtualBox VM) 


Security Tools: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), chmod, chown, systemctl 

🛡️ Hardening Steps Implemented

User Access Control: Explored the differences between Root and Standard users to implement the Principle of Least Privilege.



File Permissions: Managed file security using ls -l, chmod, and chown to ensure sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.


Network Security: Enabled the system firewall (UFW) to monitor and restrict network traffic.


Service Management: Identified running processes and disabled unnecessary services to minimize potential entry points for attackers.


📂 Deliverables

OS Security Checklist: A detailed document (PDF) covering hardening best practices.

Screenshots: Proof of firewall status, file permission changes, and service management (available in the repository).
