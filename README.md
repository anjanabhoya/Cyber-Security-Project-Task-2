# Cyber-Security-Project-Task-2
OS Security Fundamentals & Hardening (Task 2)

🛠️ Tools Used

Primary OS: Ubuntu Linux (VirtualBox VM) 


Security Tools: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall), chmod, chown, systemctl 

🛡️ Hardening Steps Implemented

User Access Control: Explored the differences between Root and Standard users to implement the Principle of Least Privilege.



File Permissions: Managed file security using ls -l, chmod, and chown to ensure sensitive data is only accessible to authorized users.


Network Security: Enabled the system firewall (UFW) to monitor and restrict network traffic.


Service Management: Identified running processes and disabled unnecessary services to minimize potential entry points for attackers.


📂 Deliverables

OS Security Checklist: A detailed document (PDF) covering hardening best practices.

Screenshots: Proof of firewall status, file permission changes, and service management (available in the repository).
